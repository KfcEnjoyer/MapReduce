In recent years wireless distributed computing technologies developed rapidly due to the advancements in wireless communications and devices. For example interconnected autonomous vehicles can utilize distributed computing for  collision avoidance and congestion management. For another example distributed computing among smart phones and nearby fog nodes can implement augmented reality for gaming or entertainment.  Other use cases of wireless distributed computing include wireless data centers, cloud computing in wireless networks, edge computing and fog computing for mobile networks and Internet of Things.  Distributed computing frameworks such as  MapReduce, Hadoop and Spark have been used in many applications that require complex computations, for example machine learning and  virtual reality.



In distributed computing systems, since a complex computational task is split and assigned to distributed nodes workers, communication is an important step that facilitates the information exchange across distributed nodes. In the MapReduce based distributed computing framework, data is first split and processed called Map at the distributed nodes, and then the results are shuffled called Shuffle, and  processed again called Reduce. As the amount of data and the number of nodes grow, heavy communication is required for data shuffling phase, which could lead to a non-negligible delay for the overall performance.
